**Predation sculpts prey school dynamics**
w/ Angela Albi, Ph.D. (MPI-AB)

Enabled by the absolutely _beautiful_ drone data that Angela and co. collected in the Maldvives, we're taking a look at how reef sharks affect prey fish schools; specifically, we're looking at how the presence of shark(s) affects school shape and size, and which strategies both species employ to maximize success while minimzing energy expenditure. More to come here!

**Human crowd dynamics and decision-making**

My long term plans are to study how certain behaviors arise in macroscopic human crowds and how the human _umwelt_ informs those behaviors. I'm currently doing field work using multi-modal imaging strategies to collect data of human crowds at music festials, night clubs, and outdoor festivals. Concurrently, I'm running mesoscopic experiments in the MPI-AB imaging hangar looking at the information gathering and navigation strategies humans employ in different contexts. Stay tuned here!

**Project Blurb:**  
Energy dissipation is a major considiration for cells, especially when they're on the move. Here, we take a look at how cells pattern their migration to sit at an 'optimal' energy expenditure and what happens when you push cells past that optimal value.

**Project Blurb:**  
Here, Gawoon and I grew MDCK-II kidneyoids and electrically stimulated them. The results were shocking! We observed that e-stim in a 3D epithelium drives what we called 'electro-inflation', causing the kidneyoids to swell to nearly 2-3x their cross-sectional area. We deduced that this was a result of ion packing at the organoid surface, disturbing the endogenous osmotic gradient that enables canonical growth in such a system. We did some fun modeling and also showcased electrotaxis in 3D for the first time ever!

### 2024 — E-cadherin biomaterials reprogram collective cell migration and cell cycling by forcing homeostatic conditions

**Project Blurb:**  
How does an epithelium behave when seeded upon a heterogenous substrate? We answered this question by growing MDCK-II tissues on a substrate that was 1/2 ECM and 1/2 E-cadherin. We saw some really cool seperations of collective behavior and a surprising effect that the E-cadherin substrate had on cell cycling. The coolest part: we observed that the boundary in substrate coating created an actual pseudo-mechanical booundary in the tissue! This became apparent when we looked at strain propogation in the tissue and saw true reflections in a contiguous tissue.

**Project Blurb:**  
How does a homogenous cue affect a heterogenous cellular population? Here, we applied global stimulation to a square cultured epithelium and characterized the differences in behavior at different parts of the tissue. Interestingly, all four edges of the tissue, as well as the center, behaved uniquely. We found that, in the context of mechanical properties and collective behavior, a short-term electrical shock performs a 'mechanical reset' in the tissue,

Even though I left UCSB long before this study was published, I was lucky enough to get to help Noah with some of the exploratory analyses looking at organ growth in _drosophila_. I highly suggest checking it out!
