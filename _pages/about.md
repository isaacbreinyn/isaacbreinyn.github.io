My name is [Isaac Boris Breinyn](https://isaacbreinyn.github.io), and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, working with [Prof. Iain Couzin](https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin). My postdcotoral research focuses on human decision making and collective dynamics in crowds, with an emphasis on how physical interactions and information flow give rise to large-scale behaviors. Broadly, I am interested in how biological systems sense and interact with their environment.

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in Quantitative and Computational Biology at Princeton University under the advisement of [Daniel J. Cohen](https://cohenlab.princeton.edu/). At Princeton, I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Princeton McGraw Teaching Fellowship.
