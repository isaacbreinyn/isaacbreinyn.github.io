My name is [Isaac Boris Breinyn](https://isaacbreinyn.github.io), and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, working with [Prof. Iain Couzin](https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin). My postdoctoral research focuses on human decision making and collective dynamics in crowds, with an emphasis on how physical interactions and information flow give rise to large-scale behaviors. 

Broadly, I am interested in how biological systems sense and interact with their environment.

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in Quantitative and Computational Biology at Princeton University under the advisement of [Daniel J. Cohen](https://cohenlab.princeton.edu/). My doctoral work focused on the biomechanics and collective behaviors of epithelial tissues. In particular, I studied the role of extraneous cues such as electrical stimuli in modulating epithelial properties. At Princeton, I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a McGraw Teaching Fellowship.

In my spare time, I enjoy excercising (rowing and weights training), sketch and improv comedy, and producing electronic music under the monicker 'Brain'.
